## If a data science analysis happens in the woods, and no one is around to hear it, does it make an impact?

## If we want to use data to ....

-   Make decisions

-   Answer scientific questions

-   Inform people on issues

-   Conduct journalism

-   And many other things

<center>

### **Data analysis is not enough**

(Which is somewhat disappointing)

</center>

## Sharing an analysis is different set of skills and tools

## What are some of the challenges you face when sharing and publishing your data science analyses?

## Jupyter: a project that transformed science

## Quarto: the last mile of scientific publishing

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that builds on standard Pandoc markdown.

## Rendering Jupyter notebooks to HTML

## Rendering Jupyter notebooks

When you render a Jupyter notebook with Quarto, the contents of the notebook (code, markdown, and outputs) are converted to plain markdown and then processed by Pandoc, which creates the finished format.

## Rendering to multiple formats

## Markdown and Code Cells

You can use any valid markdown syntax in these cells.

For code cells, there are some new components at the top of the code cell: `label` and `fig-cap` options. Cell options are written in YAML using a specially prefixed comment (`#|`).

## "Scientists are going to be able to spend more time with their families, go outside, and restore friendships because they don't have to spend so much time formatting their articles."
